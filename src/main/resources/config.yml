  # HikariCP is a library which allows us to control and cache the connections to the database
  # These settings should not be changed, unless you have an idea of what you are doing

  hikari-pool:
    # This property controls the maximum number of milliseconds that a client (that's you) will wait for a connection from the pool.
    # Lowest acceptable connection timeout is 250 ms. Default: 30000 (30 seconds)
    connection-timeout: 30000 # This means that the timeout will be 30 seconds

    # This property controls how frequently HikariCP will attempt to keep a connection alive,
    # in order to prevent it from being timed out by the database or network infrastructure.
    # When the time arrives for a "keep-alive" against a given connection, that connection will be removed from the pool, "pinged", and then returned to the pool.
    # Typically, the duration out-of-the-pool should be measured in single digit milliseconds or even sub-millisecond, and therefore should have little or no noticeable performance impact.
    # The minimum allowed value is 30000ms (30 seconds), but a value in the range of minutes is most desirable. Default: 0 (disabled)
    keep-alive-time: 0

    # This property controls the minimum number of idle connections that HikariCP tries to maintain in the pool.
    # For maximum performance and responsiveness to spike demands, we recommend not setting this value and instead allowing HikariCP to act as a fixed size connection pool.
    # Default: same as maximumPoolSize
    minimum-idle: 10

    # This property controls the maximum size that the pool is allowed to reach, including both idle and in-use connections.
    # Basically this value will determine the maximum number of actual connections to the database backend.
    # Default: 10
    maximum-pool-size: 10

    # This property controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool.
    # An in-use connection will never be retired, only when it is closed will it then be removed.
    # Minimum allowed value is 30000ms (30 seconds).
    # Default: 1800000 (30 minutes)
    maximum-lifetime: 1800000

# The format for join message
# {highest_group_prefix} - This placeholder will be replaced with the prefix of the group with the most priority for the player
# {player} - This placeholder will be replaced with the player name
